We thank the management of Side Hustle for the opportunity given to us to acquire a skill and connect with other learners from all over the country.

We appreciate our mentor for her guidance through this track.

From what we've been taught so far, we have successfully completed the capstone project for week two. We put into practice the css functions as we have been taught. We made use of the flexbox and @media function to make it responsive as instructed.
